{"en": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:"}

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\nThe answer is:"}

{"en": "Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting.

However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a $150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece.\n\n\"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\" the prosecutor stated.

His method of rolling can be best described as \"a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\" reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision.\n\nDetectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime.

Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond.

Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd.

The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts.

As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time.

This dilation can lead to increased blood flow and a temporary feeling of warmth, which might seem beneficial in a cold situation like a blizzard. \n\nHowever, this effect is counterproductive in such conditions, as the increased blood flow to the skin's surface actually promotes heat loss from the body. As a result, Tom would be at a higher risk of hypothermia compared to Dan, who did not consume alcohol.

{"en": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a $50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \n\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answer the question \"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\"?"}

Movie title: The Amazing Spider-Man Movie plot: Scientist Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) is playing hide-and-seek with his young son Peter (Max Charles) when he discovers that his study has been broken into. After quickly gathering some hidden documents, Richard and his wife Mary (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), then mysteriously depart without telling Peter where they are going.Years later, the teenage Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) has become an alienated social outcast. He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \"biocable\" is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process.

Question: suppose animal comes into contact with more sick animals happens, how will it affect More greenhouse gases are produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect\nAnswer:"}
{"en": "To answer this question, let us go through the steps:\n\nStep 1: Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities.\n\nStep 2: The earth changes energy from the sun into heat.\n\nStep 3: Heat rises from the ground.\n\nStep 4: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space.\n\nStep 5: The temperature of the earth increases.\n\nStep 6: The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps.\n\nStep 7: The temperature rises even faster.\n\nSuppose an animal comes into contact with more sick animals. This fact is on the surface unrelated to greenhouse gases production. However, if we consider that the spread of diseases among animals could potentially affect agricultural activities (such as livestock farming), which contribute to the production of greenhouse gases, we might find an indirect connection.\n\nFor instance, if more animals become sick and die or need to be culled to prevent the spread of disease, the demand for alternative sources of food might increase. Depending on these alternative sources (e.g., increased land use for crops or an increase in demand for fossil fuels for transportation), the production of greenhouse gases could either increase (more effect) or decrease (less effect) as a consequence of this perturbation.\n\nHowever, without more information on the specific alternative sources of food and their greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence on the second effect mentioned (temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I would conclude that the supposed perturbation of an animal coming into contact with more sick animals has an uncertain effect on temperature rise and the melting of polar ice caps."}

{"en": "Title: The Enchanted Circle\n\nStep 1: Introduce the main character\nSarah, a shy and introverted high-school girl, moves to a new town with her family due to her parents' job relocation. Sarah has a hard time making friends and feels out of place in her new environment.\n\nStep 2: Establish the setting\nThe story takes place in a small, close-knit town called Mooncrest, surrounded by a dense and mysterious forest, where rumors and myths about supernatural beings lurk in the shadows. The town has a deep-rooted history of witchcraft and occult practices.\n\nStep 3: Introduce the secondary characters\nSarah meets a group of three girls—Luna, Willow, and Aurora—who are seen as outcasts by their peers. The girls are rumored to be witches because of their strange behaviors, mysterious background, and fascination with the town's history.\n\nStep 4: Develop the main character's relationship with the secondary characters\nDespite the rumors, Sarah becomes friendly with Luna, Willow, and Aurora. They take her into their circle of friendship, and Sarah starts to learn about the town's dark past and the girls' complex connection to it. Meanwhile, Sarah begins to feel more confident and at ease with her newfound friends.\n\nStep 5: Introduce a conflict\nThe town experiences a series of strange and inexplicable events, such as mysterious fires and sudden illnesses that affect people who have been hostile to the girls, leading the townsfolk to believe that the girls are the cause. People begin to whisper that the girls are using witchcraft to take revenge on those who wronged them.\n\nStep 6: Present the main character's reaction to the conflict\nAs the town's fear and suspicion grow, Sarah's loyalty to her new friends is tested. She starts to question whether the girls are truly involved in witchcraft or are just innocent victims of the town's paranoia. Sarah becomes determined to find the truth and protect the girls from the mounting hysteria.\n\nStep 7: Build towards the climax\nAs Sarah delves deeper into the mysterious happenings, she discovers that there is indeed supernatural activity in the town - but not from her friends. A secret group, believing they can harness the power of the town's history, are behind the dark occurrences. They plan to use the girls as scapegoats and take control of the town.\n\nStep 8: Climax\nSarah confronts the secret group and exposes their true intentions to the townsfolk, turning public opinion against them. A battle between the forces of good and evil ensues, with Sarah teaming up with the girls to defeat the secret group.\n\nStep 9: Resolution\nAfter the secret group's plan is thwarted, Mooncrest returns to a semblance of normalcy, but the town will never be the same.

{"en": "Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule.\n\nVictoria had a strong alliance with her Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who shared her expansionist views. Together, they pushed for British involvement in global conflicts, such as the Russo-Turkish War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is crucial to note that during the Russo-Turkish War, Queen Victoria pressured Disraeli to act against Russia and even threatened to abdicate five times, showcasing her unwavering determination to assert British interests.\n\nIn her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized.\n\nFurthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it.

{"en": "Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\nA:"}

{"en": "In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia.

{"en": "In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia.

Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?.\nMe: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:"}
{"en": "Step 1: Find out how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Since Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, and that is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised, we can divide $2300 by 2 to find the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised:\n2300 ÷ 2 = $1150\n\nStep 2: Find out how much Miss Rollin's class raised. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can multiply the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised by 8 to find the amount Miss Rollin's class raised:\n1150 × 8 = $9200\n\nStep 3: Find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees. Since Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount, we can multiply the amount Miss Rollin's class raised by 3 to find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the fees:\n9200 × 3 = $27,600\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of administration fees that need to be deducted. Since 2% of the total amount raised will be deducted for administration fees, we multiply the total amount by 0.02 (2% as a decimal):\n27,600 × 0.02 = $552\n\nStep 5: Subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised to find the final amount raised for the playground:\n27,600 - 552 = $27,048\n\nSo, Tree Elementary School raised a total of $27,048 for the new playground after deducting the 2% administration fees."}

You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting!

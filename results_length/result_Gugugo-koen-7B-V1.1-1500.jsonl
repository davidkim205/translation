The application will need to include a drawing of the mark, a description of the goods or services associated with the mark, and other relevant information.\n\nThe USPTO examines the application to ensure that the mark is eligible for trademark protection and that it does not conflict with any existing trademarks. If the application is approved, the mark will be registered with the USPTO, giving the owner exclusive rights to use it in connection with the goods or services listed in the application.\n\nA word/symbol combination trademark can be a powerful tool for protecting a brand because it can prevent competitors from using similar marks that may cause confusion in the marketplace. It also provides the owner with the ability to enforce their rights in court and recover damages from infringing parties."}]}
